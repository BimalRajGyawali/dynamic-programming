### MultiStage Graph
<br>

As per [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multistage-graph-shortest-path/)

> A Multistage graph is a directed graph in which the nodes can 
> be divided into a set of stages such that all edges are from 
> a stage to next stage only (In other words there is no edge
> between vertices of same stage and from a vertex of current stage 
> to previous stage).

### Problem Statement

For a given multistage graph, find the path with minimum cost from source
to sink (destination).
