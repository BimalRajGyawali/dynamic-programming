### Problem Statement
<br>
Say that you are a traveler on a 2D grid. You begin in 
the top-left corner, and your goal is to travel to the 
bottom-right corner. You may only move down or right.
<br>

In how ways can you travel to the goal on a grid with
dimensions m * n ?
<br>

Write a function `travel(m, n)` that calculates this.
