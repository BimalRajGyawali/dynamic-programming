## Dynamic Programming
As per [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming/),
>Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimization over plain recursion.
Wherever we see a recursive solution that has repeated calls 
for same inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming.
The idea is to simply store the results of subproblems, 
so that we do not have to re-compute them when needed later. 
This simple optimization reduces time complexities from 
exponential to polynomial. <br><br>
For example, if we write simple recursive solution 
for Fibonacci Numbers, we get exponential 
time complexity and if we optimize it by storing 
solutions of subproblems, time complexity reduces to linear.

I was watching 
[a video on Dynamic Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBt53YbR9Kk)
.
The instructor implements the algorithms using Javascript. I was trying 
out the implementations in Java which I have included in this repository.
